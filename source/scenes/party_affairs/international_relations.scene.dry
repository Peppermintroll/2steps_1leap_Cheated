At the Labor and Socialist International, we can forge contacts with our fraternal socialist parties in Europe and across the world.

- @fr_uk: Build relationships with the French SFIO and British Labour Party to move their governments in Germany's favor.
- @austria: Learn organization and street fighting from the Austrian SDAPÖ.
- @scandi: Learn the path of economics and reform from the Scandinavian social democrats.
- @comintern: Forget the second international - embed a spy in the Comintern's conference.
- @america: Contact the Socialist party of America.
- @america2: Contact the Socialist party of America.
- @return: We do not need international contacts at the moment.

The socialists of France and Britain can influence their governments to be friendlier towards Germany. Hopefully they will reduce our reparations burden.

Our Reichsbanner can learn much in paramilitary organization and training from the Austrian Republikanischer Schutzbund (Republican Protection Units), the paramilitary branch of the Austrian social democrats.

[? if austrian_parliament_seen and not austrian_civil_war_seen: We are also helping the Austrian Social Democratic Worker's Party build up their resources in preparation for a future struggle, legally and illegally. ?]

The programs of the Nordic socialists involve active government intervention in the economy. We can learn from their economic strategies, and how they moved beyond their working-class base to attract a broader set of constituents.

The Stalinists of the KPD insists on calling us "social fascists", suggesting that we social democrats are as bad or worse than actual fascists. Needless to say, this is not good for our relationship with the Communists. By observing the Comintern, we can better understand the KPD, enabling us to potentially improve relations, or counter the KPD if it may come to that.

The Socialist Party of America is tiny and has limited support. There is not much we can do for them, and conversely, not much they can do for us.

The Socialist Party of America is swelling with new members who were inspired by our Olympian athletes' performance and impassioned speeches in support of socialism. They are extremely grateful to us, and promise full support once they become a force in US politics. Our party members are invigorated by this development.

We do not need the international contacts at the moment.
